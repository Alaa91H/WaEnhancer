# API 102 migration status — single source of truth

> Authoritative ledger for the WA-X libxposed API 102 feature migration.
> Updated in the SAME commit as any code change it describes.
> Generated 2026-10-09 from source-derived evidence only:
> `tools/modernization/report_api102_migration.py --json` (registry order,
> source-wiring state) × `tools/compatibility/extract_features.py`
> (per-feature resolver-dependency counts). No row claims on-device
> compatibility: every device cell is `PENDING_USER_DEVICE_TEST`.
> Device testing is the user's job and never blocks migration or merges.

## Headline counts (2026-10-09, main @ 5251fe12 + Tasker branch)

- Total registered features: 64
- Source-wired to API 102 runtime (device UNVERIFIED): 11 + 2 in flight
  (…, ContextMenuActionProvider; TypingPrivacy and HideChat on their branches,
  the first two consumers actually running on the accessor layers)
- Tasker is forward-direction only; its reverse send direction is reported
  honestly as Partial until the send pipeline migrates.
- Modern adapter present but NOT wired into `ModernXposedEntry`: 1 (MinorFixes)
- Legacy-only: 52 (50 once the in-flight branch merges)
- Device-behavior verified: 0 — recorded as `PENDING_USER_DEVICE_TEST`,
  the correct state, not a gap and never a merge blocker.
- In-WhatsApp settings surface: BUILT as the embedded Control Center (#433,
  branch `feat/issue-433-embedded-control-center`): exactly one WA X overflow
  entry opening an in-process shell with categories, search, real toggles for
  the wired adapters, an inert pending area, restart-required status and a
  Manager fallback. Device validation PENDING_USER_DEVICE_TEST. Controls for
  the still-legacy-only features stay pending until their own waves land.

## Wave / batch plan (M06.08 order, batches of 5 per task spec)

Wave rule (mechanical, refinement-allowed but never silent):

- W0 pilot/canary: the 5 wired features + MinorFixes (staged adapter) +
  DebugFeature (contract test double).
- W1 core/infra (blocking listeners, providers, controllers):
  ContactItemListener, ConversationItemListener, MenuStatusProvider,
  ContextMenuActionProvider, ActivityController, Tasker.
- W4 device/data/service edge: AntiWa, BackupRestore, CallRecording,
  CaptureDevice, AudioTranscript.
- W3 resolver-heavy: any remaining feature with ≥3 resolver dependencies.
- W2 simple single-hook: any remaining feature with ≤2 resolver dependencies.

Batch rule: Batch 0 = W0 (prior PRs, device-unverified). Batches 1–12 take
W1 → W2 → W3 → W4 in registry order, 5 features each (batch 12 has 2).
A batch merges on green CI for the exact commit plus source-level
verification (hook path, preference path, UI wiring, tests); a green build
alone is never proof a feature works. Device testing is not a merge gate.

Wave sizes today: W0=7, W1=6, W2=28, W3=18, W4=5 (total 64).

### #170 scope notes

Delivered and merged (PR #457, `44b90875`): atomic engine with quick/deep modes,
cancellation, per-check timeouts and progress by verified counts; the shared
pipeline inventory; the per-feature half that appends one hook check and one
trigger check per wired feature with the resolver chain each one reads; guided
external verification recorded per feature and bound to the WhatsApp build it
was made on; redacted SAF ZIP export verified by re-opening; verified import
and comparison of a previous archive; root-cause clustering; EN+AR+10 more
localisations.

Deliberate ceilings, stated rather than hidden:

- a feature switched off in preferences is `NOT_TESTED`, never a failing hook;
- `L4` trigger evidence exists only for the feature that reports an invocation
  counter; for every other feature the trigger check stays `NOT_TESTED`;
- `L5` is unreachable without a person with a second account confirming it,
  and the confirmation is bound to one WhatsApp build;
- the legacy features in the #337 runtime registry report no per-feature state
  to the Manager, so the scan reports them as registered, never as hooked.

Residual unknowns: instrumentation coverage now covers restart, build binding
and the no-false-L5 rule (`ExternalVerificationStoreTest`); what is still absent
is instrumentation for IPC denial and version change. The anonymised sample ZIP
schema was posted on #170.

### #455 scope notes

Root cause established from the sanitised device evidence on the issue: the
embedded Control Center built its window without a lifecycle owner, so stopping
the host leaked the window and the centre never reported as opened. That is a
root cause, not a symptom, and it is fixed at the source: the window is now
bound to the host Activity, a replaced session is retired, accepted preference
writes are drained before closing, and a creation or show failure routes through
a single Manager fallback. Unit coverage covers lifecycle identity, repeated
open/close, replacement, fallback de-duplication, save draining, callback
cancellation and failure reasons.

Still open in this issue, and stated rather than glossed over:

- the contact-data anchor is corrected and selection fails closed: no
  `firstOrNull()`, ambiguity reported as its own outcome, and a class defined by
  another loader rejected before reflection. The correction is derived from the
  legacy resolver in this repository, so it needs a device run to confirm on a
  real target; until then the per-feature state stays `PENDING_USER_DEVICE_TEST`.
- `M06_CONTACT_ACCESS_EVIDENCE` now reports candidate counts and loader
  provenance, and it will appear in the exported diagnostics archive once the
  owner runs a scan on a real build.
- the everyday-privacy order (second tick, blue tick, blue after reply, status
  viewed, last seen, typing/recording) has no migrated implementation behind it;
  the Control Center lists them as pending rather than exposing dead toggles.
- no device reproduction has been performed; every per-feature state stays
  `PENDING_USER_DEVICE_TEST`.

Issue #425 stays OPEN until the in-WhatsApp per-feature settings surface
exists (the Manager link alone is not the full acceptance criterion).
Issue #369 (F060 status-adblock regression guard) stays OPEN and is out of
scope until its feature's wave arrives.

## Per-feature ledger

Columns: runtime = source-wiring fact; UI = in-WhatsApp control state;
branch/PR/CI = change evidence; device = `PENDING_USER_DEVICE_TEST` for

## Remaining work (as of the #391 evidence-identity change)

Nothing below is claimed as done.

### Merged, device validation still outstanding

| issue | state |
|---|---|
| #170 | merged `44b90875`, **CLOSED**, anonymised schema posted on the issue |
| #455 | root causes merged `599deca6`: control-center lifecycle, contact-data anchor, fail-closed resolver selection |
| #449 | merged `67fc086b`: read receipts withheld, release-after-reply, delivery tick `UNSUPPORTED` |
| #450 | **CLOSED**: merged `67fc086b` then `4c7bff32` (#479); typing and recording reported separately; online `SERVER_CONTROLLED`; per-contact rules read from the target store |
| #451 | merged `3b6b4842`: anti-revoke, bounded retention, no protected content copied |
| #452 | merged `9a9d0a72`: Status seen privacy, separate from chat receipts |
| #357 | merged `5c8d91b6`: the Status reply seen-receipt rule; native path `NATIVE_PATH_UNRESOLVED` |
| #433 | **CLOSED**: Control Center acceptance met, verified in the tree |
| #425 | **CLOSED**: single menu entry restored, Control Center is the control path |
| #396 | **CLOSED**: merged `e6b056a0`, inherited-certification refused at the generator |
| #391 | **CLOSED**: merged `6f5e5e1e` (#480); evidence identity is package + exact version + pinned build fingerprint + account scope, enforced identically by the validator and the generator |
| #394 | merged here: the preference-key inventory sees qualified store receivers and constants outside the `PREF_*` convention |

Every row carries `PENDING_USER_DEVICE_TEST`. Sender-visible behaviour needs the
owner's second account and is not substitutable by a build.

### #391 scope notes

Evidence identity is now a full target identity rather than a package/version pair:

- `packages.<target>.certifiedBuildFingerprints[<exactVersion>]` pins the build a
  cell may claim, declared separately from any observation, so a single changed
  fingerprint cannot certify the cell (`f1094f85`, merged via #477).
- `packages.<target>.certifiedAccountScopes[<exactVersion>]` pins the runtime
  instance, and `evidence.<Feature>.targets[].account` says which instance an
  observation came from. An observation bound to a secondary profile, work profile
  or cloned instance certifies only a cell scoped to that same instance, and never
  a cell left package-wide; an observation without an account speaks for the package
  build only, so it cannot certify an instance-scoped cell.
- `sync_generated.refuse_uncertifiable_supported_cells` asks the validator which
  cells are unearned instead of re-implementing the rule, so a generated document
  can never publish a `supported` cell the validator rejects.
- `tools/compatibility/test_validate_compatibility.py` and
  `tools/compatibility/test_sync_generated.py` existed but no workflow ran them.
  Both now execute in the strict-static compatibility group, ahead of the tools
  they guard.
- The M00 evidence lock stopped counting submodule sources. `source_counts` walked
  every file under `app/src`, so the 424 vendored `.c`/`.h` files under the opus,
  ogg and libopusenc submodules were counted as WA X source. The count then
  depended on the clone rather than on the commit — 425 with submodules checked
  out, 1 without — and the lock drifted on an unchanged tree. The vendored paths
  are now read from `.gitmodules` and excluded, so `cpp` means "native files this
  project writes" and is identical on every machine. The gate is unchanged in
  strength: `test_collect_m00_baseline.py` proves both that a submodule file does
  not move the count and that a new native file of ours still does.

Deliberate ceilings: the matrix still holds 0 supported cells and no fabricated
observations. The rules refuse a claim; they do not produce one, and no resolver
evidence exists until a real device run records it.

### #394 scope notes — the preference-key inventory is no longer incomplete by design

`derived.features[*].preferenceKeys` under-reported in two provable ways, both now closed:

- **Qualified store receivers were invisible.** `Utils.xprefs` is the target-scoped
  `SharedPreferences`, and `CustomPrivacy` reads every one of its keys through it
  (`Utils.xprefs.getString("custom_privacy_type", "0")`). A pattern anchored on a
  bare `prefs.` reported the feature as reading nothing at all. The receiver is now
  matched as a receiver, qualifier included.
- **Constants outside the `PREF_*` convention were invisible.** `PinnedLimit` reads
  `prefs.getBoolean(PINNED_LIMIT_PREF_KEY, false)`. A constant reference is now
  resolved to its value and accepted when it is a `PREF_*` name **or** a key the
  Manager's preference XML actually declares. That second clause is what keeps
  `JSON_AUDIO_URL = "audio_url"` out of the inventory: an undeclared constant is
  refused, not guessed, and an unreadable contract refuses every constant rather
  than falling back to accepting names.

Before/after inventory diff, derived and committed:

| feature | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `CustomPrivacy` | `[]` | `["custom_privacy_type"]` |
| `PinnedLimit` | `[]` | `["pinnedlimit"]` |

Features with at least one provable key: **51 → 53 of 64**. The other 11 were
re-read one by one rather than assumed faulty, and none of them is a missed read:

| feature | why it has no provable key |
|---|---|
| `ContactItemListener`, `ConversationItemListener`, `MenuStatusProvider`, `ContextMenuActionProvider` | listeners/providers; they receive the store and never read it |
| `ActivityController`, `AboutContactPicker` | read `Intent` extras and the contact picker, not preferences |
| `DndMode`, `DeleteStatus`, `DownloadProfile` | take `preferences` in the constructor; the keys they act on are supplied by the caller, not read here |
| `MinorFixes` | modern adapter, staged source only, not wired into `ModernXposedEntry` |
| `DebugFeature` | contract test double |

Coverage is deliberately conservative: an unknown receiver name (`myprefs`), a
chained accessor (`ModuleRuntime.getPrefs()`), a dynamic key and a write-only key
are all refused. Under-reporting a key is recoverable; certifying a key that is not
a preference is not.

### #10 scope notes — the catalog must not claim a native path that does not exist

Inspecting F003 before building it turned up a defect that reaches past that one feature:
**every resolver name the platform catalog declares existed in no resolver.** Ten declarations —
`loadStatusComposer`, `loadStatusPublish`, `loadSendMessage`, `loadRevokeMessage`,
`loadReceiptOptions`, `loadPresenceManager`, `loadChatState`, `loadMediaTransfer`,
`loadMediaDownload`, `loadNotificationListener` — are absent from the 191 `fun load*` in
`Unobfuscator`, and every one of those features was marked `AVAILABLE`.

The engines are real and tested. What does not exist is the consumer: nothing constructs
`StatusAudioStudio`, `MediaPolicy`, `NotificationCooldownEngine`, `PresenceAlertEngine`,
`OutgoingPolicyEngine`, `MessageRevocationQueue`, the history timeline or the scheduler, and the
manifest declares no notification listener. So the fix is to say so rather than to name a resolver
that resolves nothing:

- the fictional names are gone; no feature declares a resolver it does not use;
- the ten unwired features are declared `FeatureAvailability.NOT_IMPLEMENTED` — the enum member
  that already existed for "declared, not built";
- `FeatureContractTest.aHighRiskFeatureIsCapabilityGated` now accepts "a required resolver **or**
  NOT_IMPLEMENTED". The combination it replaces — HIGH risk, no resolver, presented as available —
  is exactly what the two outbound features declared;
- a new case pins the four unwired engines to `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` and to declaring no resolver.

This adds a gate; it removes none. The source-level check that *no* resolver name in the catalog is
missing from `Unobfuscator` belongs to `tools/` and is raised as its own issue for the other lane.

### Next, in order

1. **#390 / #388** — the risk-ranked resolver audit and the compatibility-cell
   evidence gap. #391 closed the identity rule those cells will be judged by; the
   cells themselves still need a real run to earn any status.
2. **#383** — the master audit that aggregates the above.
3. **#377** — per-build WhatsApp/Business version discovery and the
   compatibility canary.
4. **#403** — the release APK growth budget, which currently watches debug only.
5. **#448** stays open on its own device gate: its four P0-CORE children are all
   merged, and closing it would close a parent whose acceptance says the
   sender-account check has to pass first.
6. **#455** stays open for the same reason: the code-side root causes are fixed,
   but the anchor correction wants a run on a real build to confirm.

### Not started

Ascending, once the items above are done: #458, #437, #400, #395, #393,
#389, #387, #386, #385, #384, #379, #378, #372, #371, #370, #369, #368, #354,
#353, #352, #351, #350, and the remainder of the open list.

### Standing constraints

- One integration branch; one visible PR per completed task.
- CI is the only place builds and tests run; no gate is ever weakened.
- Device testing belongs to the owner and never blocks a merge or a closure.
- A hook being installed is never reported as a feature working.
