"""Derive compatibility facts for T01 from the module source.

This script does not invent compatibility data. It only *derives facts* that are
provable by reading the source tree:

  * the registered feature list, taken from ``RuntimeFeatureRegistry``
  * each feature's category, taken from its package
  * each feature's resolver dependencies, taken from the ``Unobfuscator.load*``
    calls inside that feature's own file
  * the declared supported version prefixes, taken from res/values/arrays.xml
  * SDK / ABI facts, taken from app/build.gradle.kts and gradle.properties

Anything that cannot be proven statically is emitted as ``unknown``. Declaring a
feature ``supported`` requires runtime resolver evidence, which this script does
not have; that evidence is collected at runtime and folded back in by T51+.

Normally this module is imported by validate_compatibility.py rather than run
directly. Run it standalone to inspect the facts:

    python3 tools/compatibility/extract_features.py            # print JSON
    python3 tools/compatibility/extract_features.py --out F    # write to F

To refresh compatibility.json's ``derived`` section, or to check it for drift:

    python3 tools/compatibility/validate_compatibility.py --sync
    python3 tools/compatibility/validate_compatibility.py
