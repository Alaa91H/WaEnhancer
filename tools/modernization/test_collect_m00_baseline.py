"""Self-test for tools/modernization/collect_m00_baseline.py.

This tool was written with an explicit rule in its own docstring: no machine-specific values in
the baseline, because a file that differs per machine trains everyone to ignore `--check`. The
first CI run broke that rule. `actions/checkout` configures the origin as
`https://github.com/Alaa91H/WA-X` while a local clone has `...WA-X.git`, so the gate reported
drift on a tree that had not changed.

The failure was caught by the gate the same change had added, which is the argument for having
the gate. This test is the argument for keeping the fix: it makes "the baseline means the same
thing on every machine" a checked property instead of a documented intention.

The three cases below cover the three ways this tool can stop being trustworthy: recording
something about the clone instead of the repository, failing to notice real drift, and producing
different output for the same input.

Usage:
    python3 tools/modernization/test_collect_m00_baseline.py
Exit codes: 0 every case behaved as expected, 1 a case did not.
