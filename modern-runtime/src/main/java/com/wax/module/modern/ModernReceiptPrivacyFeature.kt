/**
 * API 102 port of the receipt privacy family (#449).
 *
 * Three behaviours that must stay separate, because they are different claims:
 *
 * 1. **withhold read receipts** — the sender does not learn the message was
 *    read. This is a protocol statement, so it is implemented by withholding
 *    the outbound read receipt, never by hiding a tick on screen.
 * 2. **release after my reply** — while the receipts are withheld, one real
 *    reply in the same conversation releases the eligible receipts exactly
 *    once. A draft, a cancelled send, a queued send or a reply to another chat
 *    must not release anything.
 * 3. **withhold delivery receipts** — the sender does not learn the message
 *    arrived. Whether that is possible at all is a question about WhatsApp's
 *    server, not about this module. This feature does not answer it by
 *    pretending: it reports [Outcome.UNSUPPORTED] with the reason, because a
 *    toggle that changes nothing is worse than one that says it cannot work.
 *
 * Every failure path returns to native behaviour. When the resolver is
 * ambiguous, the signature is unexpected, or the DEX scan fails, this module
 * sends whatever WhatsApp would have sent: withholding a receipt that the user
 * asked to withhold is the safe direction, and failing open on *hiding* would
 * leak the read the user asked to protect.
 *
 * Targets come from the legacy resolver in this repository, which found them
 * on real builds:
 * - the read-receipt send: a method using
 *   `ReadReceipts/sendReceiptForIncomingMessage`;
 * - the outbound job that carries it: the class ending in `SendReadReceiptJob`
 *   and its method using the literal `receipt`.
